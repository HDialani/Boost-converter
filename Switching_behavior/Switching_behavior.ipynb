    "## 2.1 Parasitic capacitor\n",
    "In an ideal world, transistors would turn on instantly. However, in the real world, it takes some time till the transistor is switched from \"OFF\" to \"ON\". This is because there is a parasitic capacitance between the gate and source of the MOSFET. (This explanation uses MOSFET, but the same can be said about IGBT). This parasitic capacitance causes the transistor to turn on very slowly. Normally these switches take a few $ns$-$us$ so a little delay isn't that bad, however too big a problem comes from what happens in between going from turning \"OFF\" to \"ON\". Here \"ON\" means $V_{DS}$=$0V$. For those that don't know MOSFETs have 3 operating regions: cut-off region, resistive/linear region, and saturation region. Read this if you want to understand more [read this](http://electricalarticle.com/power-mosfet-construction-operation-iv-characteristic/) or [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3M2sOCGCKs). Ps saturation and linear region are often mixed up with beginners. The reason is that for BJT both region's names are swapped ðŸ™ƒ look at this [fun thread](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/498561/in-which-region-should-a-mosfet-be-operated-as-a-switch). \n",
    "\n",
    "So now that you know all the 3 regions you can understand what the problem is when the switch turns \"ON\" very slowly. The switch will be in the saturation region for a long time. During the saturation region, current will flow through the MOSFET while there is still a voltage difference between drain and source, so there will be a lot of power lost over the transistor. The animation below shows this effect the MOSFET is first in cut-off then due to the parasitic capacitor it stays in saturation for a while then it finally enters the linear region. A problem with microcontrollers is that they can't give a lot of charges. They usually give between $4-20 mA$. So this will cause the capacitor to take forever to charge. For a power MOSFET, it will take ages since its parasitic cap is extremely large. So the gate driver steps in and delivers a large amount of current compared to the microcontroller thus charging the parasitic capacitor faster. Besides charging this capacitor the gate-driver also discharges this capacitor. Power MOSFETs have large parasitic caps, so even if you remove positive voltage the gate voltage can stay the same voltage for a while. So to quickly discharge the capacitor the gate driver supplies negative voltage to turn the transistor \"OFF\". "

    "The larger $V_{GS}$ is the larger the slope becomes. Since $R=V/I$ a larger slope results in a smaller resistance. Even though this resistance is already in the $m\\Omega$ range this play a huge role in conduction loss since $I$ is usually very large. Therefore it is more desirable to have the highest possible $V_{GS}$. With gate drivers, their output voltage is dependent on the voltages that are supplied to them. So for example the NCP81080 [datasheet](https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/ncp81080-d.pdf) can supply $20V$ to turn the switch \"ON\" and supply $-5V$ \"OFF\". The max possible voltage is transistor dependents so check its datasheet to see the max possible voltage both positive and negative."

But that if for a very simply model without parasitics plus that was only a step response not even a square wave response. It is not worth it to derive a mathematical model with parasitics and add a MOSFET/IGBT in this model when a simpler solution exists. The solution is to plot these in LTSpice. For example look at the RLC circuit below. Here all you need to do is add the square wave input setup your RLC circuit with the correct values and plot. No mathematical model needed.
