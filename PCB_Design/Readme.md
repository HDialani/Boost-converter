# Read me

All PCB's will be designed in Kicad. I could do it in Altium, but I want to make this as open-source as possible. Which makes this more time consuming since all self designed PCBs are made in Altium...

# Don't produce these PCBs !!!

They are already made, so I will not produce these. So please don't try to produce these PCBs cause they could have errors. There now you can't sue me :p
