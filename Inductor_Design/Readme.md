# Readme
This folder explains how I made the inductor, then how well it worked compared to the practical model.

## Theoretical design design
The steps taken to design this inductor are from the Texas Instrument articles in the article folder, with some modifications in steps taken. 

### Application
 * This is a boost converter so it is a single winding inductor.
 * I was given the operation mode is CCM, but DCM seems more logical. Sources: https://www.quora.com/What-is-differences-between-CCM-and-DCM-mode-in-buck-boost-converter-How-can-I-choose-the-right-mode and https://www.designnews.com/selecting-your-boost-converter-inductance
