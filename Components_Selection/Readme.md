Hi here I want to go over the components selection that were done. Material type and final values as well as an explanation as to what to pay attention to when selection component and values.

## Capacitor
Let's start with capacitor. In general there are 3 types of capacitor materials:Film capacitor, Multilayer Ceramic chip capacitor(MLCC's) and Electrolytic Capacitors (E-cap). They can be further divided into more sub catagories. More on that later. I am going to summarize the resutls in the table below. Most of the values are from the source:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v8zBj7_sxg

E-cap | low | $150^0 C$ | high | mid/large |THT/SMD | low kHz | low | high | #9 | #10 | DC Link, Low frequency Energy storage
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
Film | mid | $110^0 C$ | low | mid/large | THT | High MHz |  | high| mid | 276 | Decoupling,Filter with certain cut-off frequency,High reliability application, EMI suppresion
MLCC's| high| $200^0 C$ | mid | lowe | SMD | can go to GHz | high | low | 272 | 276 | Decoupling,High frequency Energy storage,Filter with rough cut-off frequency, EMI suppresion
 Criterias | Cost | Max temp | Ripple current | Size | Mouniting | frequency range of operation | Reliabily of not breaking over time | energy density | 272 | 276 | Typical applicitation
