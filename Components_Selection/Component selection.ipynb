    "Let's start with capacitor. In general there are 3 types of capacitor materials:Film capacitor, Multilayer Ceramic chip capacitor(MLCC's) and Electrolytic Capacitors (E-cap). They can be further divided into more sub catagories. More on that later. I am going to summarize the results in the table below. Most of the values are from the source:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v8zBj7_sxg"
