Due to this higher switching frequency the voltage measurement jumps when the current changes shape. Keep in mind with the shunt the voltage is measured not the current. So the voltage overshoots and then decays due to the inductance. It just happens to resembles $I_{diode}$. That actually can help prove this hypothesis I should measure $I_{diode}$ for the MOSFET using the shunt and see of it also has this same shape "
