For this setup the OAR3 - R020FI was used here is it's [datasheet](https://www.ttelectronics.com/TTElectronics/media/ProductFiles/Datasheets/OAR.pdf) "

Everytime there is a sudden change in current the shunt's inductance causes a voltage overshoot. Thankfully there is a way of removing this large overshoots and that is to filter out the high frequencies. The image below shows the results where the scops was set to $500 kHz$ bandwidth.\n",
