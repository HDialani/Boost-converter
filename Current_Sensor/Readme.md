# Readme
Current sensors so many options, but which one is the right one? I was forced to learned systems engineering so I guess I might aswell us it.

There are multiple types, but I only had access to Resistive shunt,Hall sensor,Rogowski Coil and Current transducer. So many option but which one is best?
## Options

### Resistive shunt used OAR3 - R020FI
Pretty straighforward the resistance the voltage being applied is also know, so the current can be calculated. The typical value for a shunt is in the mOhm's, this way the voltage drop over the shunt is insignificant. 

Pro's
* Measure AC and DC
* Linear I=V/R
* Cost â‚¬1.08

Con's
* Current needs to flow through it
* No isolation
* Very noisy
