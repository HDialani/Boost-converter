    "This will explain what gets hot, how to calculate the temperature rise, simulate it, measure it and finally compare theory and practice. If components get too hot they can explode. So it is important to understand heat and to make sure things don't get too hot. Heat is generated by losses, so the best way to make sure something doesn't get to hot is to have an extremely efficient system, but even with the most efficient system cooling might be needed due to the amount of power going through the system. Another way is to transfer the heat produced from the hot object(component) to a cold object(cooling method), just like using ice to cool off during summer. "

    "The losses can be calculated as $P_{resistive} [W]=I_{out}^2 [A] \\cdot R_{load} [\\Omega]$. If a single resistor is used it will get all the losses, but if multiple resistors are used the $P_{resistive}$ is divided over the resistors. Once losses it known now the thermal resistance, which is usually given with the symbol $R_{\\theta}$ in $[^{\\circ}C/W]$ of load is needed. So the final equalibrium temperature of the load without any cooling can be calculated as $T_{resistor}=I^2 \\cdot  R \\cdot R_{\\theta}$. The speed in which the load reaches is dependent on the thermal capacitance, which is usually given with the symbol $C_{\\theta}$ in $[J/K]$. The larger the thermal capacitance the longer it will take till for the load to reach its equilibrium state. Think of it as a RC Charging Circuit, but with temperature instead of voltage."

    "### Conduction\n",
    "Before calculating the theoretical temperature rise of an diode it is important to understand what causes losses in and inductor. There are 2 types of losses conduction losses and switching losses. Conduction loss  happens when the diode is not blocking the current from flowing. Switching loss is when the diode is turning on or off and there is still current present during the transition.For the conduction there are 2 sources of losses, its resistance during the period when it is conduction $R_{dson}$ and the forward voltage drop $V_{f}$.\n",
    "So its conduction loss can be calculated as $P_{diode-conduction}=V_{f}*I_{out}+R_{dson}*I_{out}^2$. \n",

    "### Switching loss\n",
    "Next is the switching loss. In an ideal world when positive voltage is applied a diode conducts and then if a negative voltage is instantly applied no current flows through the diode. Look at the image below the dotted lines. In practice this does sort of happen when a positive voltage is applied current conduct through the diode and when negative voltage is applied no current flows through the diode, however what happens in between transition is where it the difference appears. In practice you get the image on the right(The straight line with blue area). Watch these [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT8kCmXbSDg) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBqLOrlA7QI). During reverse recovery current the circuit is negative. When the switch is closed the inductor side is stuck on ground and when the switch is open $V_{source}+V{L}>V_{out}$. So during reverse recovery the switch is going from open to closed. So there is a negative voltage over the diode. So that gives a positive power value, thus power is lost. The interesting question is where does this power lost go to ?   \n",

    "Interesting note regarding the reverse recovery decreasing the parasitic inductance won't change the area of the blue region. It will only make the $di/dt$ sharper thus making more EMI. Higher forward current will also cause this loss to increase. So the only way to minimize this is to operate the diode at lower current or pick the correct diode for the job. For thos interested a schottcky diode is the [answer 1](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-reverse-recovery-time-is-nearly-zero-in-Schottky-diode) [answer 2](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/200507/what-exactly-determines-recovery-time-of-schottky-diodes).
