# Readme
This will explain what gets hot, how to calculate the temperature rise, measure and compare finally compare theory and practic.

## What gets hot
![](Images/Boost_converter_schematics.jpg)

Looking at the model either the inductor(L),transistor(S),capacitor(C), diode(D) or load can get hot. 

## How to calculate the temperature rise
 For the transistors and diode they follow the same top level approach. Since these are used in "high power" application a heatsink is needed, else they will fry. shows a cross section of chip on heatsink and below that you can see the how the heat transferes.

A nice overview of each component and how they effect the temperature of the IC.
