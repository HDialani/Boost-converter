# Readme
This folder [Code](Code) has the entire Python code for this part.The Jupyter notebook [Thermal.ipynb](Thermal.ipynb) goes into detail regarding theory, simulations and result I found. The folder [Images](Images) are just images used for the Jupyter notebook explaination.


# Cooling options

So the following are the commenly used cooling options: Air, forced air cooling, heatsink, heatsink and forced air and water cooling. This table looks ugly in Jupyter notebook so I am putting this part here.

Method                 | Cost                                                               | Cooling effect  |Space               | Effort | Risk
---                    | ---                                                                | ---             | ---                | ---    | ---
Air                    | Free                                                               |                 |Takes no extra space|        |        
Forced air             | Needs fans,powersupply for fan and optional PWM controller for fan |                 |      |        |
Heatsink               | Needs a big piece of metal with fins                               |  
Heatsink and forced air| Needs both the above mentioned things                              |
Water cooling          | Needs water, tubes, pump with powersupply and controller to move water and reservoir to store water|
