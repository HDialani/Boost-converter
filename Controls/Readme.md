Unlike the other folders this one has 2 jupyternotebook files. One is Basic Control theory, which goes over some basic level control theory. The second one is Implemented controls, in this one I explain how I made the Simulink code I eventually made and implemented on the microcontroller for the boost converter. In case you are curious I made an open loop and closed loop model that. For the open loop I only did CCM mode duty cycle control and not both DCM/CCM mode, since I didn't have much time and no current sensor at the output. For the closed loop it works almost perfectly... I need to implement a ramp function, which once again I would, however I had no more time and had to move on to another projectðŸ˜¢.
