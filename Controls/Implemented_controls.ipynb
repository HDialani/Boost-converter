Option 1 I design the entire thing in Simulink and then use the built in Embedded Coder Simulink submodel and then let it do all the data conversion. This way I only need to use Simulink and then press built hardware and I am done. The second option is I make the entire code in C using the free Code Composer Studio program from Texas Instruments.\n",

Simulink is a lot more user friendly, easier to follow and debug, but it isn't free sadly. In practice controls engineers do complicated controls using Simulink/Matlab, thanks to my university I also get both for free so I decided to do everything in Matlab/Simulink. Maybe later I can try and do this is C/C++, but I can't promise this."

In this case I have control over the load, but in practice this is not always the case. So what can I control? There is only one thing left the transistors gate signal. I can control how fast it turn ON/OFF and how long it does that. And that is what I will use"
