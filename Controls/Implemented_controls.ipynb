In practice controls, engineers do complicated controls using Simulink/Matlab, thanks to my university I also get both for free so I decided to do everything in Matlab/Simulink. Maybe later I can try and do this in C/C++, but I can't promise this. I made everything using Matlab 2020 B."

In this case, I have control over the load, but in practice, this is not always the case. So what can I control? There is only one thing left the transistors gate signal.
