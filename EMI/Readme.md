The magical world of EMI, everyones nightmare. 

# What is EMI?
EMI stands for electromagnetic interference. Switch mode power supplies(SMPS) are more efficient than linear power supplies, however it comes at the cost of being a lot noisier. The steps response causese a lot of interferience with electronics around it, so ideally any noise sensative components should be far away as possible, for example any analog measuring circuit. When designing a PCB it needs to not have too much EMI, would be bad if a heart monitering stops working due to a lot of external interferience. So to make sure this doesn't happen the EMI of the designed PCB needs to be taken into account. BTW interferience and noise aren't the same thing. Interferience effect other electronics and noise is from inside that electronic component.
